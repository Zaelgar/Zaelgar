# About Me
Video games have been my favourite hobby since I played my first cereal box game.

Since the beginning, I have loved using computers and learning more about them. Games like Gizmos and Gadgets, an educational game from 1993, started my love for science and learning how things work. Much later, when the original Crysis game was released, I learned to love game development by using the Sandbox Editor to make my own levels with custom behaviours.

But it wasn't enough. Using these amazing tools was a great introduction, but along the way, I learned about programming. It was a way to combine my interest in video games with my growing curiosity about how they work.

Today, I'm learning as much as I can to feed that curiosity. I have a special interest in new and whacky ways to make something faster or more intuitive. New ways to make hard non-cheating AI for strategy games, natural simulations for more realistic environments, or innovative gameplay mechanics really excite and inspire me. As a professional, I strive to learn and do more for my teams and for myself in order to be an excellent asset to any project.


# What I Like About Games
The experience I most often look for in games usually fits into a few catagories for me.

I love co-op games. Anything to do with either couch co-op or PvE will usually get me to play a game at least once. There's something about using teamwork with friends that just makes me giddy. I'm also not a very competitve person and I hate playing against people, so that probably has something to do with it too.

Another thing I look for in games is a groundbreaking tech implementation or an interesting game mechanic. I still remember watching Chris Taylor talking about using crowd simulation research to implement flowfield pathfinding when Supreme Commander 2 was in development.

# My Focuses
As a freshly graduated student, I realise just how much there is out there that I don't know. In an industry like this there are cool algorithms, faster implementations, and completely new technology introduced daily. To that effect, my main goal is to start working as a game programmer in the industry and start learning all that I can. On my own time, my projects generally focus on the things I mentioned in "What I Like About Games" section. I love working on features and projects that I would be interested in as a player. When possible, I try to implement these things within my own Klink engine which can be found on my github. My favourite project so far is the hydraulic terrain system I implemented with Klink Engine, also available here.
